# Week 0 — Review 

### This week, I learnt about and had the opportunity to use a variety of new tools and technologies:

1 - AWS Account: an AWS account is where you create and manage your AWS resources, and it also gives you control over access and invoicing. </br>

2 - GitHub: is a platform for collaboration and version control. </br>

3 - Gitpod: is an open source platform for developers that automates the provisioning of development environments that are ready for coding. </br>

4 - GitHub Codespaces: A container is used by GitHub Codespaces, an instant, cloud-based development environment that gives you access to popular                                  programming languages, tools, and utilities. </br>

5 - Lucidchart: Users may create and share expert flowchart diagrams using Lucidchart, which offers templates for anything from project management to                       brainstorming. </br>

6 - Honeycomb: is designed to assist teams in making wise investments in performance optimization for better user experiences. </br>

7 - Rollbar: is a bug tracking and monitoring service available in the cloud for businesses of all sizes. </br>


### Let's now discuss various cloud services offered by AWS:

1 - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): It is important to set up MFA to your AWS accounts our any accounts you own in general. Why Is MFA Vital? The main                                          advantage of MFA is that it will increase the security of your company by forcing users to provide identification                                          other than a login and password. </br>

2 - AWS CloudShell: You can start the pre-authenticated, browser-based AWS CloudShell right from the AWS Management Console. Using Bash, PowerShell, or Z                       shell as your preferred shell, you can execute AWS CLI commands against AWS services. </br>

3 - AWS Organization: Amazon Organizations is an account management tool that enables you to combine numerous AWS accounts into a single, centrally managed                       organization. You can create member accounts using organizations and invite current account holders to join your organization. </br>

4 - AWS CloudTrail: By monitoring user behaviour and API usage, CloudTrail provides audits, security monitoring, and operational troubleshooting. To give                       you control over storage, analysis, and corrective measures, CloudTrail records, continually monitors, and stores account activity                         connected to actions throughout your Amazon infrastructure. </br>

5 - AWS IAM User: A resource in IAM with related credentials and permissions is known as an IAM user. A person or program that utilizes its credentials to                   submit requests to AWS might be represented as an IAM user. The term "service account" is frequently used to describe this. </br>

6 - AWS Billing: Amazon Billing and Cost Management is a web service that offers tools for bill payment and cost optimization. You only pay for what you                    use by having Amazon Web Services bill your account for usage. </br>

7 - AWS Billing Alert: Together with the expected total of your AWS charges, this information contains the estimated costs for each service in AWS that you                        utilise. When your account billing surpasses the set threshold, the alert is set off. Only when the current billing surpasses the                          threshold does it activate. </br>

8 - AWS Cost Allocation Tags: Following activation, Amazon organizes your resource charges on your cost allocation report using the cost allocation tags to                               help you categorize and track your AWS expenses. User-defined tags and tags generated by AWS are the two different forms of                                 cost allocation tags offered by AWS. </br>

9 - AWS Cost Explorer: AWS Cost Explorer is a tool that enables you to view and analyze your costs and usage. You can explore your usage and costs using                          the main graph, the Cost Explorer cost and usage reports, or the Cost Explorer RI reports. </br>

10 - AWS Calculator: You can use the online planning tool AWS Price Calculator to generate estimates for your AWS use cases. You may use it to model your                        solutions before you construct them, look up the prices for Amazon services, and check the math that went into your estimates. </br>
